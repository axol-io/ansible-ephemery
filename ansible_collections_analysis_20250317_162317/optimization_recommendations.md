# Ansible Collections Optimization Suggestions
Generated on Mon Mar 17 16:23:17 CET 2025

This report provides suggestions for optimizing the Ansible collections.

## Recommendations

### Multiple Collection Directories

**Observation**: Two collection directories were found:
- collections/ansible_collections
- .ansible/collections

**Recommendation**: Standardize on a single collection directory, preferably collections/ansible_collections, as it is more explicitly named and appears to be the main collection location.

**Implementation**:
1. Move any unique collections from .ansible/collections to collections/ansible_collections
2. Update ansible.cfg to specify collections_paths = ./collections
3. Remove the .ansible/collections directory
