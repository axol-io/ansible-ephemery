# Script Templates

This directory contains standardized templates for creating new scripts in the Ephemery project.

## Templates

- `script_template.sh`: Standard template for new bash scripts

## Usage

To create a new script using the template:

1. Copy the template to your target directory:
   ```bash
   cp development/templates/script_template.sh my_new_script.sh
   ```

2. Modify the script header to include your script's purpose, usage, and author information.

3. Implement your script logic in the main function.

4. Make sure your script follows the project's coding standards and includes proper error handling.

## Script Structure

All scripts should follow this general structure:

1. Shebang and header comments
2. Script usage and author information
3. Environment setup and error handling
4. Common library sourcing
5. Command-line argument parsing
6. Main function declaration
7. Helper function declarations
8. Main function execution

## Coding Standards

- Use the common library functions for consistency
- Include proper error handling
- Validate all inputs and prerequisites
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex operations
- Follow the principle of least privilege
