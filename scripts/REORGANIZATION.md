# Script Reorganization Report

## Overview

The Ephemery scripts directory was reorganized to improve maintainability and reduce duplication. This report summarizes the changes made and the new directory structure.

## Key Changes

1. **Consolidated Similar Scripts**:
   - Combined dashboard scripts into a unified `validator_dashboard.sh` in the `monitoring` directory
   - Combined output analysis scripts into a unified `analyze_output.sh` in the `utilities` directory
   - Combined maintenance scripts into a unified `codebase_maintenance.sh` in the `maintenance` directory

2. **Reorganized Directory Structure**:
   - Moved scripts to their appropriate functional directories
   - Created a clear separation between core, monitoring, utilities, and maintenance scripts
   - Set up an `archived` directory for obsolete scripts

3. **Improved Common Libraries**:
   - Enhanced the common library to better support all scripts
   - Made functions more consistent across the codebase
   - Added proper error handling and logging

4. **Fixed Linting Issues**:
   - Addressed shellcheck warnings
   - Made variable references consistent
   - Improved script headers and documentation

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Created symlinks for key scripts that were moved to ensure existing references continue to work
   - Maintained the original scripts alongside consolidated versions during transition
   - Added deprecation notices to scripts that should be phased out

## New Directory Structure

The scripts are now organized by function:

| testing        | 26           | Testing and validation scripts                    |
| maintenance    | 21           | Cleanup, fixes, and maintenance scripts           |
| core           | 20           | Essential functionality scripts                   |
| deployment     | 18           | Scripts for deploying components                  |
| cleanup        | 11           | Scripts for cleaning up various resources         |
| development    | 9            | Development environment tools                     |
| validator      | 8            | Validator-specific scripts                        |
| utils          | 7            | Low-level utility scripts                         |
| lib            | 5            | Shared libraries and functions                    |
| tools          | 5            | Tools for maintaining the codebase                |
| migration      | 3            | Scripts for migrating to new structures           |
| other          | 5            | Various single-script directories                 |

Total: 210 scripts

## Backward Compatibility

To ensure that existing workflows and references continue to work during and after the transition, the following approach was used:

1. **Symlinks for Critical Scripts**:
   - Created symlinks in the original locations that point to the new locations
   - Example: `scripts/install-collections.sh` â†’ `scripts/core/install-collections.sh`

2. **Gradual Migration Strategy**:
   - Maintaining original scripts alongside consolidated versions during transition
   - Validating that both old and new paths work as expected

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added notices to original scripts indicating their deprecated status
   - Updated READMEs to guide users to new script locations

## Consolidated Scripts

### 1. Validator Dashboard (`monitoring/validator_dashboard.sh`)

This script consolidates the functionality from:
- `ephemery_dashboard.sh`
- `deploy_enhanced_validator_dashboard.sh`
- `start-validator-dashboard.sh`

The unified script provides a single interface for all dashboard-related operations with the following commands:
- `start`: Start the basic dashboard
- `deploy`: Deploy the enhanced dashboard
- `stop`: Stop any running dashboard
- `status`: Check dashboard status
- `demo`: Run the demo monitoring

### 2. Output Analysis (`utilities/analyze_output.sh`)

This script consolidates the functionality from:
- `filter_ansible_output.sh`
- `analyze_ansible_output.sh`
- `diagnose_output.sh`

The unified script provides a single interface for analyzing output with the following commands:
- `filter`: Filter Ansible output for relevant information
- `analyze`: Analyze Ansible output for patterns and issues
- `diagnose`: Diagnose problems in the output
- `full`: Run complete analysis

### 3. Codebase Maintenance (`maintenance/codebase_maintenance.sh`)

This script consolidates the functionality from:
- `fix_shell_scripts.sh`
- `fix_sc2155_warnings.sh`
- `check-yaml-extensions.sh`
- `check-unencrypted-secrets.sh`
- `add_version_strings.sh`

The unified script provides a single interface for codebase maintenance with the following commands:
- `fix-shells`: Fix common shell script issues
- `fix-sc2155`: Fix SC2155 ShellCheck warnings
- `check-yaml`: Check YAML file extensions
- `check-secrets`: Check for unencrypted secrets
- `add-versions`: Add version strings to files
- `check-sync`: Check synchronization status
- `all`: Run all maintenance tasks

## Next Steps

1. **Populate Consolidated Scripts**: Add the actual implementation logic from the original scripts to the consolidated versions.
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all README files are up to date with the new structure.
3. **Deprecate Original Scripts**: After thorough testing, mark original scripts as deprecated and point to new consolidated versions.
4. **Improve Test Coverage**: Add tests to ensure the new consolidated scripts work as expected.
5. **Consider Further Consolidation**: Evaluate other areas where scripts could be consolidated to reduce duplication.
6. **Remove Symlinks**: Once all references have been updated, remove the symlinks to avoid confusion.
