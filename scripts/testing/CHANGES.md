# Testing Framework Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the Ephemery testing framework to improve its functionality, particularly focusing on mock capabilities and test standardization.

## Key Changes

1. **Created a standardized `init_test_env` function template**
   - Located in `scripts/testing/tests/template/init_test_env.sh`
   - Provides consistent environment initialization across tests
   - Configures mock behavior when running in mock mode
   - Sets appropriate test parameters based on the execution mode

2. **Fixed path issues in tests**
   - Corrected PROJECT_ROOT path calculation in JWT auth test
   - Standardized path references to use TEST_FIXTURE_DIR and TEST_REPORT_DIR
   - Added error handling for missing core utilities

3. **Enhanced mock framework**
   - Added mock implementations for Linux-specific tools not available on macOS
   - Added journalctl, systemd-analyze, and apt-get mocks
   - Added ansible-playbook mock implementation
   - Updated override_commands and restore_commands functions

4. **Created fixture Ansible playbooks**
   - Added test_validator_setup.yaml for validator testing
   - Added client_combinations_test.yaml for client compatibility testing
   - Created client_combination_task.yaml for testing different client pairs

5. **Improved performance test parameters**
   - Added dynamic configuration based on mock mode
   - Reduced test duration, sample interval, and sample count in mock mode
   - Added MOCK_TEST_DURATION and MOCK_WAIT_INTERVAL variables

6. **Added documentation**
   - Created README.md in the template directory
   - Updated main testing README.md
   - Added comments explaining the purpose of each function

## Modified Tests

The following tests have been updated to use the standardized init_test_env function:

1. `scripts/testing/tests/auth/test_jwt_auth.sh`
2. `scripts/testing/tests/chaos_testing/test_network_disruption.sh`
3. `scripts/testing/tests/performance_benchmark/test_sync_performance.sh`
4. `scripts/testing/tests/genesis_validator/test_genesis_validator_setup.sh`
5. `scripts/testing/tests/genesis_validator/test_validator_lifecycle.sh`
6. `scripts/testing/tests/client_combinations/test_client_compatibility.sh`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the changes**
   - Run tests in mock mode to verify the changes
   - Check that tests properly handle missing dependencies

2. **Add more mock implementations**
   - Identify additional tools that need mock implementations
   - Add mock implementations for specific test scenarios

3. **Create additional fixture playbooks**
   - Add fixtures for other test categories
   - Ensure fixtures are minimal but functional

4. **Add cleanup function**
   - Consider adding a standardized cleanup function to the template
   - Ensure proper cleanup after tests

5. **Improve test reporting**
   - Implement more comprehensive test reporting
   - Add result aggregation across test suites
