## Architectural Principles

The Ansible Ephemery architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Modularity** - Components are designed with clear boundaries and interfaces
2. **Consistency** - Naming conventions and patterns are uniform throughout the codebase
3. **Testability** - Components are structured to facilitate comprehensive testing
4. **Simplicity** - Designs favor straightforward approaches over complex solutions
5. **Documentation** - Architecture is thoroughly documented for maintainability

## System Context

Ansible Ephemery is designed to:

- Deploy and manage Ethereum client infrastructure for ephemeral networks
- Support multiple client combinations (execution and consensus layers)
- Provide monitoring and management capabilities
- Enable reproducible testing environments
- Simplify validator setup and management
