3. **Documentation**: All completed tasks must include updated documentation
4. **Task Dependencies**: Tasks blocked by other tasks will be marked with ⚠️ and include a note about the dependency

## Task Assignment Guidelines

1. Tasks will be assigned based on skill sets and availability

```
# Week X Status Report (Date Range)
