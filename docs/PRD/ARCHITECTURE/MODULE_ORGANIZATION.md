# Module Organization

This document describes the organization of modules and code within the Ephemery Node project. It provides guidance on how the codebase is structured and organized to maintain clarity and facilitate maintenance.

## Overview

The Ephemery Node codebase follows a modular organization approach that separates concerns and promotes reusability. This document outlines the principles behind this organization and provides details on the module structure.

## Module Structure

The codebase is organized into the following primary modules:

1. **Core** - Essential functionality required by all components
2. **Clients** - Client-specific implementation and configuration
3. **Validator** - Validator-related functionality
4. **Monitoring** - Monitoring and observability tools
5. **Deployment** - Deployment and provisioning tools
6. **Utilities** - Helper functions and common utilities
