# Component Architecture

This document details the component-level architecture of the Ephemery Node system. It describes how individual components are designed and how they interact with each other.

## Overview

The Ephemery Node system is composed of multiple components that work together to provide a complete node deployment and management solution. This document outlines the design and responsibilities of each component.

## Component Organization

1. **Execution Clients** - Components responsible for executing the Ethereum state transition function
2. **Consensus Clients** - Components responsible for consensus and chain selection
3. **Validator** - Components responsible for validation and block proposal
4. **Monitoring** - Components responsible for observability and alerting
5. **Management** - Components responsible for orchestration and administration

## Inter-component Communication

This section will detail how components communicate with each other, including protocols, interfaces, and data flows.
