## Overview

The Ephemery testnet utilizes various dashboards to monitor performance, node status, and overall health of the network. The synchronization dashboard specifically visualizes the sync progress of both execution and consensus clients, as well as detailed checkpoint sync information. It provides both real-time status and historical data to help users monitor their node's synchronization progress.

## Dashboard Architecture

The dashboard implementation includes the following components:

1. The dashboard HTML template (`ansible/templates/sync_dashboard.html.j2`)
2. The sync monitor script (`ansible/templates/sync_monitor.sh.j2`)
3. Nginx configuration for serving the dashboard (`ansible/templates/nginx-dashboard.conf.j2`)
4. Ansible tasks for deploying the dashboard (`ansible/tasks/sync-status-monitor.yaml`)

## Implementation Status

The current implementation status of dashboard features:

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Basic Dashboard UI | ‚úÖ Completed | Basic HTML/CSS dashboard with client status cards |
| Sync Progress Bars | ‚úÖ Completed | Visual indicators of sync progress for both clients |
| Historical Data Chart | ‚úÖ Completed | Chart.js implementation to show sync progress over time |
| Checkpoint Sync Visualization | ‚úÖ Completed | Visual representation of checkpoint sync stages |
| Web Server Configuration | ‚úÖ Completed | Nginx configuration for serving the dashboard |
| Mobile Responsiveness | üöß In Progress | Optimizing the UI for mobile devices |
| Advanced Filtering Tools | ‚è≥ Pending | Tools for filtering and analyzing sync data |
| Real-time Updates | ‚è≥ Pending | WebSocket implementation for real-time updates |

## Setup and Configuration

### Enabling the Dashboard

The dashboard can be enabled in your inventory file by setting:

```yaml
sync_dashboard_enabled: true
```

### Installation

To deploy the dashboard:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml ansible/playbooks/sync-status-monitor.yaml
```

### Access

Access the dashboard at:
```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/ephemery-status/
```

## Visualization Components

The dashboard includes several visualization components:

1. **Status Cards**: Display the current sync status of execution and consensus clients
2. **Progress Bars**: Visual indicators showing the percentage completion of the sync process
3. **Historical Chart**: Line chart showing sync progress over time
4. **Checkpoint Sync Display**: Visual representation of the checkpoint sync process and stages

## Testing

To test the dashboard implementation:

1. Deploy the monitoring system with the dashboard enabled
2. Access the dashboard at the configured URL
3. Verify that:
   - Both execution and consensus client cards show status correctly
   - The historical chart displays data points
   - The checkpoint sync visualization shows the correct stage
   - The dashboard refreshes automatically
   - All data is being correctly updated

## Integration

### Integration with Other Monitoring Systems

The sync dashboard can be integrated with other monitoring systems:

- **Prometheus Integration**: The JSON data can be exposed as Prometheus metrics
- **Grafana Integration**: Create a Grafana dashboard using the exposed metrics
- **External Monitoring**: The JSON endpoints can be used by external monitoring tools

## Roadmap

### Pending Tasks

1. **Improve Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Add responsive breakpoints for smaller screens
   - Reorganize elements to fit better on mobile
   - Implement a mobile-first navigation pattern
   - Implementation location: `ansible/templates/sync_dashboard.html.j2`

2. **Add Advanced Filtering Tools**
   - Add date range selectors for historical data
   - Implement client-specific data filtering
   - Create comparison tools between different time periods
   - Implementation location: `ansible/templates/sync_dashboard.html.j2`

3. **Implement Real-time Updates**
   - Implement a WebSocket server for pushing updates
   - Add client-side WebSocket connection in the dashboard
   - Create fallback to polling if WebSockets are not available
   - Implementation location: Create new WebSocket server script and update dashboard template

### Future Enhancements

Beyond the current roadmap, future enhancements could include:

- User customizable dashboard layouts
- Advanced alerting system with notification preferences
- Multiple theme support including dark mode
- Dashboard account system with saved preferences
- Mobile app integration using the same data sources
