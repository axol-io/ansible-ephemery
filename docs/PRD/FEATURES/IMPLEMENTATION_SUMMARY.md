- Ensured the script uses standardized paths from the configuration file
- Made the script executable

### 2. Updated Documentation Paths

- Updated the README.md to use consistent paths for scripts
- Created comprehensive documentation for validator management in `docs/PRD/FEATURES/VALIDATOR_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Ensured all script references use the wrapper script path

### 3. Clarified Dashboard Integration

- Created detailed documentation for dashboard integration in `docs/PRD/FEATURES/DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION.md`
- Explained the relationship between terminal-based and Grafana dashboards
- Provided setup instructions for both dashboard options

### 4. Standardized Configuration Paths

- Ensured all documentation references the standardized configuration paths
- Documented the configuration paths in the validator management documentation
- Updated script references to use the standardized paths

### 5. Documented Integration Test Script

- Created comprehensive documentation for the integration test script in `docs/PRD/FEATURES/VALIDATOR_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`
- Updated the `test_validator_config.sh` script to include integration test functionality
- Ensured the integration test script is accessible through the wrapper script

### 6. Verified Script Dependencies

- Ensured all scripts referenced by other scripts exist and are properly integrated
- Updated the wrapper script to correctly reference all validator management scripts
- Documented the script dependencies in the validator management documentation

### 7. Updated Script Directory Structure

- Ensured the script directory structure matches what's described in the documentation
- Documented the script directory structure in the validator management documentation
- Updated script references to use the correct paths

### 8. Clarified Prometheus Integration

- Created detailed documentation for Prometheus integration in `docs/PRD/FEATURES/PROMETHEUS_INTEGRATION.md`
- Explained how Prometheus is integrated and configured in the Ephemery system
- Documented the metrics sources and their endpoints
