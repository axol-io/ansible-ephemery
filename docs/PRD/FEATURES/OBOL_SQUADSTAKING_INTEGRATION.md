# Obol SquadStaking Integration

## Overview

The Obol SquadStaking integration enables Ephemery nodes to support distributed validator technology, enhancing security and reliability through validator clusters. This feature will allow Ephemery to serve as a testing environment for Obol's distributed validator solutions, providing a platform for testing distributed validator concepts and technologies.

SquadStaking, powered by Obol's Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), allows multiple operators to jointly operate a validator, enhancing security by distributing the validator key and requiring threshold consensus for operations. This approach reduces single points of failure and minimizes slashing risk, delivering on Obol's core value proposition of "Better Performance, More Rewards, Less Risk."

As the largest Decentralized Operator Ecosystem, Obol focuses on scaling layer 1 blockchains and decentralized infrastructure networks by providing technology, opportunities, and community for operators. The Ephemery integration will serve as a crucial testing ground for these capabilities.

## Operator Categories and Benefits

Obol's ecosystem serves multiple stakeholder categories, each with distinct benefits:

1. **Staking Protocols**: Rapidly scale and decentralize protocol security and resiliency
2. **Node Operators**: Enhance key security and node performance while earning more delegated stake
3. **Home Stakers**: Run nodes with peers to access new opportunities for staking rewards
4. **Stakers**: Earn staking rewards while improving stake security

Our Ephemery integration will provide testing capabilities for all these stakeholder categories.

### Experience

Operators will gain practical experience with distributed validators through:
- Getting distributed validators operational on testnet through guided technical workshops
- Accessing hands-on technical assistance for setup and operation
- Testing various validator cluster configurations in the Ephemery environment

### Earn

Techne Credential holders can unlock enhanced earning opportunities:
