# Lido CSM Integration

## Overview

The Lido Community Staking Module (CSM) integration enables Ephemery nodes to support liquid staking functionality through Lido's staking protocol. This feature will allow Ephemery to serve as a testing environment for Lido's permissionless staking solutions, enhancing the testnet's utility for staking protocol developers and community validators (including solo stakers and home stakers).

CSM is designed as a permissionless entry pathway for independent community stakers to participate in the Lido on Ethereum protocol as Node Operators. The key requirement is providing a security bond, which serves as collateral for all of a Node Operator's validators.

## Objectives

1. Implement full support for Lido CSM within the Ephemery ecosystem
2. Create deployment tools and playbooks for easy CSM setup
3. Develop monitoring and alerting specific to CSM operations
4. Provide comprehensive documentation for CSM integration and usage
5. Enable testing of staking protocol features in the Ephemery testnet environment
6. Develop specialized tools for CSM node operators to optimize operations
7. Create comprehensive validator and ejector monitoring systems for CSM
8. Build bond management and optimization tools for operators
9. Implement stake distribution queue monitoring and analytics
10. Create Node Operator-specific management interfaces
