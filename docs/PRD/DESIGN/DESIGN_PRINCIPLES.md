# Design Principles

This document outlines the core design philosophy and principles that guide the development of the Ephemery Node project.

## Overview

The design principles of Ephemery Node prioritize reliability, security, maintainability, and performance. These principles inform all technical decisions and architecture choices throughout the project.

## Core Principles

1. **Reliability**: The system must be reliable and robust against failures.
2. **Security**: Security is a fundamental requirement, not an add-on feature.
3. **Maintainability**: Code and architecture must be maintainable over time.
4. **Performance**: The system must perform efficiently under various load conditions.
5. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones, when possible.
