## Design Philosophy

The Ansible Ephemery project is built on a foundation of automation, security, and flexibility. The design emphasizes:

1. **Simplified Complexity** - Making complex deployments accessible
2. **Predictable Behavior** - Ensuring consistent results across environments
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple defaults with options for advanced configuration
4. **Secure by Default** - Security as a fundamental design consideration
5. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Clear documentation at all levels

## Design Process

The project follows these design processes:

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understanding user needs and system requirements
2. **Pattern Selection** - Applying appropriate design patterns
3. **Implementation** - Translating design into code
4. **Testing** - Validating design through testing
5. **Refinement** - Iterative improvement based on feedback
