## Getting Started

For new users and developers, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started Guide](./GETTING_STARTED.md) which provides an overview of the project and basic setup instructions.

## Documentation Principles

This documentation follows these core principles:

1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Documentation is organized by category and concern
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept has one authoritative document
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Documentation starts with overviews and progresses to more detailed information
4. **Cross-Referencing**: Documents reference each other where appropriate
5. **Standardized Formats**: Each document type follows a consistent template
6. **Living Documentation**: Documentation evolves with the codebase

## Documentation Structure

The PRD system has been fully populated with content previously found in our flat documentation structure. All redundant documents have been eliminated, creating a single source of truth for all project documentation within this organized hierarchy.

## Current Priorities

The current high-priority initiatives include:

1. **Advanced Validator Performance Monitoring**: We have made significant progress on our enhanced metrics collection, dashboards, and alerting systems for validator performance. The implementation includes real-time performance metrics, visual dashboards, customizable alerting, and historical data analysis.

2. **Checkpoint Sync Reliability Improvements**: We have implemented comprehensive fixes for checkpoint sync issues, including multi-provider fallback, automatic URL testing and selection, sync monitoring, and automatic recovery procedures.

3. **Dashboard Enhancement**: We have expanded our dashboard capabilities to include both sync status monitoring and validator performance monitoring, with real-time updates, historical data visualization, and alerting systems.

4. **Documentation Improvements**: We continue to enhance our documentation with better organization, improved troubleshooting guides, and updates to reflect recent feature additions.

5. **Configuration Standardization**: We have implemented a comprehensive configuration standardization system to ensure consistent paths, environment variables, and configuration across all components of the Ephemery system.

## Recently Completed Features

1. **Data Management Tools**: We have implemented comprehensive data management tools:
   - Disk space optimization through configurable data pruning levels (safe, aggressive, full)
   - Layer-specific pruning options (execution-only, consensus-only)
   - Secure validator key backup and restore with encryption
   - Slashing protection data management
   - Comprehensive safety measures to prevent data loss
   See [Data Management](./FEATURES/DATA_MANAGEMENT.md) for more details.

2. **Health Check System**: We have developed a comprehensive health check system:
   - Multiple check types (basic, full, performance, network)
   - Detailed status reporting for all components

2. **Checkpoint Sync Performance Optimization**: Further improving our checkpoint sync implementation with additional performance optimizations, more robust recovery mechanisms, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

3. **Integration Testing Framework**: Developing a comprehensive testing framework to ensure reliability and performance across different environments and configurations.

4. **Enhanced Troubleshooting Tools**: Expanding our automated troubleshooting capabilities with additional tools and scripts to diagnose and resolve issues.
