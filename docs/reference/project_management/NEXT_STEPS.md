# Next Steps for Implementation Plan

This document outlines the immediate next steps for continuing the implementation plan based on recent progress.

## Recent Achievements

We have made significant progress on several key initiatives:

1. **Shell Script Reliability Improvements**
   - Fixed critical syntax errors in multiple shell scripts
   - Added automated fix utilities (fix_shell_scripts.sh, fix_sc2155_warnings.sh)
   - Improved variable handling to prevent readonly variable conflicts
   - Enhanced pre-commit hooks to catch shell script issues early
   - Fixed test framework to properly detect network resets

2. **Dependency Management Standardization**
   - Created a comprehensive dependency validation script (`simple_validate_dependencies.sh`)
   - Fixed version constraints in core requirements files
   - Generated detailed reports of dependency consistency
   - Created shell-compatible tools that work across different environments
   - Identified 68 remaining issues across 10 dependency files

## Priority Tasks for Next Week

### 1. Complete Shell Script Quality Improvements

- **ShellCheck Integration**
  - Address remaining ShellCheck warnings across all scripts
  - Create documentation for shell script best practices
  - Implement automated testing for shell script compatibility

- **Testing Framework Enhancements**
  - Improve test support for macOS and other non-Linux platforms
  - Create additional test cases to validate shell script behavior
  - Enhance test reporting with more detailed error information

- **CI Integration**
  - Integrate shell script validation into CI pipeline
  - Add test coverage metrics for shell scripts
  - Create automated report generation for shell script quality

### 2. Complete Dependency Management Standardization

- **Remaining Requirements Files**
  - Update collection-specific requirements files following our standard
  - Create test requirements to verify that all dependencies are resolved correctly
  - Add documentation examples to requirements files

- **Documentation**
  - Complete the dependency management documentation with examples and best practices
  - Document the validation script and how to use it in the CI/CD pipeline
  - Add dependency management section to the contributor guide

- **CI Integration**
  - Integrate dependency validation into CI pipeline
  - Add pre-commit hook for dependency validation

### 3. Implement Code Quality Tools

- **YAML Linting**
  - Add yamllint to ensure consistent YAML formatting
  - Implement YAML schema validation for configuration files

- **Documentation Linting**
  - Add markdownlint for documentation consistency
  - Implement link checking for documentation

### 4. Continue DVT Architecture Design

- **Architecture Document**
  - Complete initial architecture design document for DVT integration
  - Document key interfaces between Ephemery and DVT implementations
  - Define security model for distributed validation

- **Integration Points**
  - Identify specific integration points with Obol and SSV
  - Define API requirements for DVT integration
  - Document networking requirements for secure node communication

### 5. Validator Key Password Management

- **Integration Completion**
  - Finalize integration with validator setup workflow
  - Complete deployment verification tests
  - Update documentation with password management best practices

- **Migration Guide**
  - Create migration guide for existing deployments
  - Develop automated recovery for common password issues
  - Document validation procedures for key/password compatibility

## Timeline

| Week | Key Deliverables |
|------|------------------|
| Week 1 | - Complete dependency management standardization<br>- Set up initial shellcheck configuration<br>- Complete DVT architecture design |
| Week 2 | - Implement CI integration for validation tools<br>- Fix critical shellcheck issues<br>- Begin DVT infrastructure implementation |
| Week 3 | - Complete validator key password management integration<br>- Finalize shell script quality improvements<br>- Create DVT test environment |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Collection dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Test with all collection combinations before finalizing |
| Shell compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Test scripts in different environments (bash, zsh, sh) |
| DVT specification changes | Low | High | Monitor upstream projects and maintain flexibility in design |

## Success Criteria

The next phase will be considered successful when:

1. All dependency files follow the standardized version pinning format
2. Code quality tools are integrated into the development workflow
3. DVT architecture design is complete and approved
4. Validator key password management is fully integrated and tested
