# Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) Support initiative aims to implement support for leading DVT solutions, specifically Obol Network and Secret Shared Validators (SSV) Network. This will enable validators to operate in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, enhancing security, resilience, and decentralization of the validation process.

## Current Status

As of May 2023, initial research on DVT implementations has been completed, and the architecture design for DVT integration is currently in progress. The implementation of this initiative will build upon the existing Ephemery Node infrastructure and the recently completed Lido CSM Integration with Advanced Validator Performance Analytics.

## Objectives

1. Design and implement a robust architecture for DVT integration in Ephemery
2. Support leading DVT implementations: Obol Network and SSV Network
3. Create comprehensive monitoring and management tools for distributed validators
4. Develop documentation and guides for DVT setup and operation
5. Implement testing frameworks for DVT configurations
