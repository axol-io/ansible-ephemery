# Dependency Management Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for managing dependencies in the Ephemery project. Dependencies include Python packages, Ansible collections, and other external resources that the project relies on.

## Goals

- Ensure consistent dependency versions across development, testing, and production environments
- Minimize dependency conflicts
- Document the purpose and usage of each dependency
- Establish a clear process for adding, updating, and removing dependencies
- Support reproducible builds and deployments

## Current State

Dependencies are managed using:

- `requirements.txt` - Core Python dependencies
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development-only Python dependencies
- `requirements.yaml` - Ansible collections

## Dependency Management Guidelines

### Python Dependencies

1. **Version Pinning**:
   - Core dependencies should use exact version pinning: `package==1.2.3`
   - Development dependencies can use compatible release operator: `package~=1.2.3`

2. **Dependency Categories**:
   - Runtime dependencies go in `requirements.txt`
   - Development/testing dependencies go in `requirements-dev.txt`
   - Group dependencies with comments to indicate their purpose

3. **Updating Dependencies**:
   - Review updates for breaking changes before upgrading
   - Test thoroughly after updating dependencies
   - Document significant updates in the changelog

### Ansible Collections

1. **Version Pinning**:
   - Use exact version pinning for core collections: `version: "==1.2.3"`
   - For less critical collections, use bounded version ranges: `version: ">=1.2.3,<2.0.0"`

2. **Collection Categories**:
   - All collections are listed in `requirements.yaml`
   - Group collections by purpose or provider

3. **Updating Collections**:
   - Test collection updates with integration tests
   - Document role compatibility with collection versions

## Tools and Automation

### Dependency Verification

The `validate_versions.sh` script checks that:
- All packages have proper version pinning
- Dependencies are consistent across files
- No conflicting dependencies exist

### Installation

Installation should be done using the provided scripts:
```bash
# Install all dependencies
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh

# Install only Python dependencies
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh --python-only

# Install only Ansible collections
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh --ansible-only

# Install development dependencies
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh --dev
```

## Dependency Locations

Primary dependency files:
- `./requirements.yaml`
- `./requirements.txt`

## Rollback Process

If dependency updates cause issues:

1. Revert to previous dependency files
2. Run installation script to downgrade
3. Document the issue for future reference

## Dependency Documentation

Each new dependency added should be documented:
- Purpose and functionality it provides
- Why the specific version was chosen
- Any known limitations or issues

## Dependency Review Process

When adding new dependencies:
1. Evaluate alternatives and select the most appropriate option
2. Check license compatibility
3. Assess security implications
4. Test compatibility with existing dependencies
5. Document the dependency as outlined above
6. Submit for review with justification

## Security Considerations

1. Regularly check dependencies for security vulnerabilities
2. Update vulnerable dependencies promptly
3. Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
4. Prefer well-maintained dependencies with active communities

## Conclusion

Following this dependency management plan will help maintain a stable, reproducible environment across all stages of development and deployment.
