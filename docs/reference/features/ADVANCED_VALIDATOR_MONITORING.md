   - `historical_analyzer.sh`: Long-term trend analysis

2. **Dashboard Implementation**
   - `validator_dashboard.sh`: Main dashboard interface
   - `performance_visualizer.sh`: Data visualization components
   - `alert_display.sh`: Alert integration for dashboard

3. **Alert Engine**
   - `alert_engine.sh`: Alert condition monitoring
   - `alert_manager.sh`: Alert generation and delivery
   - `alert_config.sh`: Alert configuration management

4. **Analytics Engine**
   - `performance_analyzer.sh`: Performance analysis tools
   - `efficiency_calculator.sh`: Efficiency scoring system
   - `recommendation_engine.sh`: Optimization recommendations

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- Dashboard refresh rate: 5 seconds or less
- Metrics collection overhead: <1% CPU utilization
- Storage requirements: <100MB per validator per month
- Alert latency: <30 seconds from event to notification

### Integration Requirements

### Command-Line Interface

For users who prefer command-line interfaces, the system provides:

```bash
# Display the validator dashboard
./scripts/monitoring/advanced_validator_dashboard.sh

# Check validator performance summary
./scripts/monitoring/advanced_validator_metrics.sh --summary

# Configure alert settings
./scripts/monitoring/alert_config.sh --configure

# Generate performance report
./scripts/monitoring/performance_analyzer.sh --report daily
```
